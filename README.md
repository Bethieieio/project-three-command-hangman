# Console Hangman

## Introduction
Console hangman is the classic game of hangman but it is played in the console.
The aim is to guess the word in six tries. If the user guesses the word is less than 6 tries, they win the game. If the user does not guess the word, it is game over. The user is then asked if they would like to play again.
Each failed guess more and more features of a stick figure would appear on the gallows until it is complete.
